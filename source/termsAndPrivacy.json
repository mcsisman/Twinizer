This Privacy Policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the \u201cApplication\u201d).   Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using Twinizer you signify that you have read, understood and agree to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nWe reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.  We will alert you about any changes by updating the \u201cEffective Date\u201d date of this Privacy Policy.  You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.  \n\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-application virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you.  We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party. \nCOLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION\nWe may collect information about you in a variety of ways.  The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use.\n\nWe only collect information as stated below. This information is being used for analytical purposes and purpose of the application to work properly. To the extent information covered by this Privacy Policy is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as \u201cPersonal Data\u201d. We do not collect or store any other data (including Personal Data) unless you provide it voluntarily. When provided voluntarily, we will not distribute or share your information with any third party without your consent. \n\nWe collect the following types of information (hereinafter \u2013 \u201cCollected Information\u201d): \n\nAnalytics information \n\nWe use analytical tools of our third-party providers (hereinafter \u2013 \u201cThird Party Providers\u201d) such as Google Cloud and servers, Facebook Analytics, and Firebase to help us measure traffic and usage trends for Twinizer. These tools collect information sent by your device or Twinizer including log file information, cookies, device identifiers and the web pages you visit when following the links available to you on Twinizer. Third Party Providers aggregate the collected data so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User. This collected data provides us with analytics and measurement reports so that we can improve Twinizer. \n\nCookies and similar technologies\n\nWhen you use Twinizer, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Twinizer and provide features to you. We may ask our partners to serve the services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party. \n\nLog file information\n\nLog file information is automatically reported by Twinizer each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) it. It can also be provided when the content of Twinizer is downloaded to your device. \n\nWhen you use Twinizer, our Third-Party Providers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on Twinizer, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of Twinizer. \n\nDevice identifiers\n\nWhen you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access Twinizer, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more \u201cdevice identifiers.\u201d Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device\u2019s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Twinizer. \n\nA device identifier may deliver information to us or to Third Party Provider about how you browse and use Twinizer and may help us or others provide reports. Some features of Twinizer may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. \nAmong others we collect the following device identifiers: \n\u2022\tUser Device ID \n\u2022\tPlatform (iOS/Android) \n\u2022\tDevice OS Version \n\u2022\tApp Version \n\u2022\tFirst request time \n\u2022\tLanguage \n\u2022\tRegion/Country \n\u2022\tTimezone \n\u2022\tModel \n\u2022\tApp Version   \n\nData used due to the operation of the application\n\nUsers will register with their own e-mail address while registering for the application. Therefore, we will use this e-mail address data. When starting the application, users must enter a username, gender, country, date of birth and bio. In addition, users must upload 5 photos in order to realize the purpose of the application. One of these photos will be the user's profile photo. Other users will only be able to see the user's profile photo. We will model and save the face data of the person in these 5 photos with a face recognition algorithm. Nobody else will be able to access this. When other users search for faces similar to the face they searched, they will compare it with the models we use and list the users with the most similar faces. Thus, other users will be able to see profile photo, gender, country, username, date of birth and bio information. We will collect and use all the data listed above for the purpose of the application to work properly.\n\nIn addition, in terms of messages between users, the messaging between two users is stored in our database until it is read by the other party. However, it is not used. When the other user reads the message, this data is deleted from our database permanently.\n\nWe do not collect and use data such as location data, contacts data. We just want permission to access the phone's photo gallery and camera. The reason for this is that users can upload their photos properly and use the application properly.\n\nWe will also ask users for notification permission so that users can properly use the app's messaging feature. However, if they do not give this permission, they will be able to use the application, but they will be able to see the messages when they enter the application.\nHOW WE USE YOUR DATA\nCollected Information is used mainly for analytical purposes in order to constantly improve and maintain our services, including among others, for ensuring the technical functioning of our network, to help preventing fraudulent use of Twinizer and for developing new services.\n\nAs we said before, we will use \"Google Cloud\" and \"Firebase\" systems of Google for the operation of our application. Firebase is a system that receives data from the phone by encrypting it and sends it encrypted. For more detailed information about Firebase, you can visit: https://firebase.google.com/docs \n\nWe do not share the e-mail addresses users use to log into the application. Firebase creates a \"User ID\" for each user. This way, other users can only find the user's User Id. They cannot access their stored data such as e-mail or passwords. The passwords of the users cannot be seen by us. Firebase sets up this pairing process.\n\nWe set the security rules for the application. We control what data users can and cannot access.\n\nFinally, we do not sell any of your data to third parties for commercial purposes. We cover our operating costs from the advertisements we receive.\nDISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION\nWe may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows: \n\nBy Law or to Protect Rights \nIf we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.  This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n\nThird-Party Service Providers \nWe may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.  \n\nInteractions with Other Users \nIf you interact with other users of the Application, those users may see your name, profile photo, bio, birthday, gender and country. \n\nThird-Party Advertisers \nWe may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Application. These companies may use information about your visits to the Application and other websites that are contained in web cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. \n\n\nSale or Bankruptcy \nIf we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity.  If we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a third party.  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline honor commitments we made in this Privacy Policy. \n\nWe are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or sensitive data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations.  If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails or other communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly. \n\nHOW WE STORE, PROCESS AND TRANSFER YOUR DATA\n\nWe store and process your data with the service provided by Google Cloud.
